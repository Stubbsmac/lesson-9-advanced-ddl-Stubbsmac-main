# CIS250_Create09_Advanced Data Definition Language & Data Retrieval
For this assignment you will be using a jupyter notebook to learn more about the advanced functions of Data Definition Language, as well how to complete complex data retrieval tasks using set operators and window functions. There is a graded scenario at the end of the notebook that has been broken up into a series of exercises.

## If Something Goes Wrong
The tables that we are working with this week are created during completion of the notebook. If there is an issue, please drop the tables and run the create scripts found in the notebook to restore them.

## Before Starting
1. Ensure that you have completed the practice assignment succesfully.
2. Complete the Practice Jupyter Notebook assignment.
3. Complete the Module 7 Create Assignment

## Assignment Description
* The scenario will guide you through scripting create statements using constraints, writting more efficient drop statements, comparing two queries using set operators, and aggregating data without grouping rows by using window functions.
* Each of these tasks are broken up into an individual exercise that you will be able to practice and refer back to.

## Assignment Requirements
* You must write all of your scripts in the Create file and check it into github
* For full credit your scripts must return the requested result exactly
* You must use best practices in your scripts. Proper casing, spacing, and formatting are required.
* Your submitted file should show that you have -- ran -- the scripts that you are submitting.

## Tips
* When dropping tables, be mindful of if another table is dependent on the table you are trying to delete.
* Pay careful attention to the structure of Transaction scripts.
* If you get stuck, make a post in the Homework Help channel in Teams.
